# musicweb

This is where I listen to music on a daily basis.
This was made using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The codes are pretty well-documented (I think), but it is not the best?

Anyways, I just use audio files from YouTube.
I don't pirate them. There's a hidden iframe containing YouTube API stuff.

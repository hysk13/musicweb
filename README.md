# musicweb

This website was supposed to be where I listened to music on a daily basis.
This was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The codes are pretty readable to some extent (maybe).

Anyways, I just use audio files from YouTube iframe embeds.
This was an interesting idea to come up with...
You can make this website your own by editing the 'source.js' file.

Update: I don't think I use this website anymore...
